Heyo Everyone, here is how to use the submission spammer thing,
Go to the form you wanna do it on and go to inspect elements (CTRL+Shift+I For Windows)
If you look on your tabs you see Elements, Console and other things. You want to press Network
It may have some things but don't worry about them now.
Fill out the form with any random stuff you can think off, and once you click submit you should see a new thing appear on your screen,
Once you click on it You may see Headers, Preview, Response
Click Headers
In the top you'll see a Request URl:
Copy that url required and replace it in the code where it says "url = 'FORM LINK'" replace that 'FORM LINK' with the url
Now you need to scroll down in the headers of that website till you see "Form Data"
You'll see a bold letter with a colon then with the response you put
On the bold word you want to replace that in the code where it says 
'email@email.com': email,
'discord': name,
'message': message,
And replace both text's with that bold letter for each line required 
Now you should be able to run and enjoy!
